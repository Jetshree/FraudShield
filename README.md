# FraudShield AI - Fraud Detection System

FraudShield AI is a comprehensive fraud detection system built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with integrated machine learning capabilities. This system helps businesses detect and prevent fraudulent transactions in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time transaction monitoring and risk assessment
- AI-powered fraud detection using machine learning models
- User-friendly dashboard with data visualization
- Alert management system for suspicious activities
- Detailed transaction analysis and reporting
- Role-based access control (admin, analyst, user)
- Audit trail for all system activities

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main components:

```
fraud-detection-ai/
├── frontend/          # React frontend
├── backend/           # Express server
└── ai/                # AI/ML components
```

### Frontend (React)

The frontend provides a user interface for viewing and managing fraud alerts, user authentication, dashboards, and reports.

### Backend (Express + MongoDB)

The backend provides API endpoints, business logic, and database interaction using MongoDB.

### AI Component

The AI component contains the machine learning models for fraud detection, data processing, and analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fraudshield-ai.git
   cd fraudshield-ai
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies
   ```
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies
   ```
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Configure environment variables
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` in the backend directory
   - Update the variables as needed

5. Start the development servers

   Backend:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

   Frontend:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## API Documentation

The backend provides the following API endpoints:

- **Auth API**: User registration, login, profile management
- **Transaction API**: Transaction monitoring and risk assessment
- **Alert API**: Alert management and processing
- **Report API**: Data analysis and reporting
- **Dashboard API**: Summary statistics and visualizations

## AI Models

The fraud detection system uses several machine learning models:

1. **Transaction Risk Assessment**: Evaluates the risk level of each transaction
2. **User Behavior Analysis**: Detects unusual patterns in user behavior
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies outliers in transaction data
